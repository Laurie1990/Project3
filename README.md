# Project 3- Machine Learning

## About this project

* This project aims to use machine learning to help identify households where children are most at risk of leaving education and participating in the labour market.
*  In many developing countries, this is a significant issue which prevents educational attainment for children, generally leading to lower lifetime incomes, 
* and makes the accumulation of human capital difficult foir further economic development in these countries.
* This project utilizes a datasource collected by the [SMERU Research Institute](https://smeru.or.id/en/about), which conducted a study on the effects of Uncoditional Cash Transfers (UCT's) on child labour within households.
